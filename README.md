## GymBro Capstone Project Roadmap

### 1. Project Overview

GymBro is a tech-driven platform designed for fitness enthusiasts who travel frequently and need short-term access to gyms without committing to long-term memberships. Through GymBro, local gyms can register their facilities and offer flexible, short-term plans (like daily, weekly, or 15-day passes) to travelers. Users can search for gyms in their destination city, book short-term memberships, and access verified gym facilities without the hassle of long-term contracts. This solution bridges the gap between travelers’ fitness needs and gyms' untapped revenue potential.

### 2. Problem Statement

When people travel for work, leisure, or personal commitments, they often struggle to maintain their fitness routine due to the lack of flexible gym membership options. Most gyms only offer monthly or yearly plans, which are impractical for short stays. Meanwhile, gyms have unused capacity during off-peak hours and miss out on potential revenue from short-term customers.

**Pain Points:**

* Lack of short-term gym membership options.
* Difficulty in finding reliable and well-equipped gyms in unfamiliar cities.
* Underutilized gym capacity leading to missed revenue opportunities.

### 3. Solution

GymBro addresses these challenges by creating a two-sided marketplace:

* **For Gym-Goers:** A seamless platform to find, book, and access short-term gym memberships in any city.
* **For Gyms:** A way to monetize unused capacity and attract a new customer base.

**Key Features:**

* Location-based search for gyms.
* Flexible membership plans (daily, weekly, 15-day passes).
* Verified gym profiles with amenities, reviews, and ratings.
* In-app booking and secure payment system.
* Real-time availability and dynamic pricing.
* Optional personal trainer and class bookings.
* Push notifications for offers and booking reminders.

### 4. Technical Approach

**Tech Stack:** MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)

**Project Milestones:**

* **Phase 1: Planning & Design**

  * Requirement gathering and market research.
  * Low-fidelity wireframes and user flow.
  * High-fidelity UI/UX design (Figma).
  * Database schema design and normalization (MongoDB).
  * Competitor analysis to shape GymBro’s unique value proposition.

* **Phase 2: Backend Development**

  * Setup Node.js/Express server.
  * Create REST APIs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with proper routing.
  * Implement JWT-based authentication and authorization.
  * Database integration (MongoDB) with schema validation.

* **Phase 3: Frontend Development**

  * Setup React.js project with Tailwind CSS.
  * Build reusable components (forms, search, gym cards, modals).
  * Integrate with backend APIs for seamless data flow.
  * Implement file upload (gym images, user avatars).

* **Phase 4: Deployment & Testing**

  * Deploy backend (Render/Heroku).
  * Deploy frontend (Vercel/Netlify).
  * Write unit tests with JEST and integration tests.
  * Conduct thorough QA to ensure design and functionality alignment.

### 5. Feasibility & Timeline

**Estimated Duration:** 8–10 weeks

**Resources Required:**

* Design tools (Figma)
* Development environment (VS Code)
* Database (MongoDB Atlas)
* Hosting platforms (Netlify, Render)

**Potential Challenges:**

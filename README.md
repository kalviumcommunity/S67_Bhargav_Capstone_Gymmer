# Gymmer Capstone Project

## Idea Brief

**Gymmer** is a platform built for fitness lovers who travel frequently and want access to local gyms **without committing to long-term memberships**. Gyms can sign up and offer flexible plans — daily, weekly, or 15-day passes — to accommodate these short-term users.

This project combines my passion for **fitness** and **tech**, and addresses a real-world problem: **staying fit while on the move**.
